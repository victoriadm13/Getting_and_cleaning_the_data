# Getting_and_cleaning_the_data

This repository hosts the databases and the R code for the Course Project of the "Getting and Cleaning the Data" Coursera course. 

I use the following database: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Files:

run_analysis.R : R script

  1) Load the data & assign descriptive names.
  
  2) Merge the data into to one database.
  
  3) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  
  4) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

CodeBook.md - Code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

tidy_database.txt - tidy dataset

averages.txt - dataset containing the output of point 4)
